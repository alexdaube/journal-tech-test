# Thinkific Multi-User Journal Assignment

## Getting Started

### 1. Get to know project tech stack

This simple project is a starting point for your take-home test. It is built with the following technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/), a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a frontend framework for server-side rendering, easy routing, serverless RESTful API
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), a database ORM for Node.js
  - Scaffolding is set up for SQLite
  - You are free to use other databases of your choice

### 2. Install npm dependencies

```
yarn
```

### 3. Create .env file

```
cp .env.example .env
```

### 4. Prepare DB

Create a local SQLite database and run migrations.

```
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

Seed the database with the sample data from [`prisma/seed.js`](./prisma/seed.js).

```
npx prisma db seed --preview-feature
```

### 5. Start the app

```
yarn dev
```

The app is now running, navigate to [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser to explore its UI.

### Date Or Reflection

December 4, 2021

### Location of deployed application (not necessary for Junior Engineers)

https://journal-tech-test.herokuapp.com/

### Instructions to run assignment locally

The database was changed to postgres for production purposes.

##### Prerequisites 
 * Make sure that docker and docker-compose CLI is installed on your machine
 * Make sure nothing is running locally on port 5432. Usually another postgres database...

##### Start the database with docker
```zsh 
// At the root of the project in a command line shell
docker-compose up postgres
```
All the other commands are still valid once this is set up.

### Time spent
Development: 4 hours
Deployment and questions: 2 hours
Total: 6 hours

### Assumptions made

- I assumed that it would be ok to use a modal instead of dedicated page for the new post form.
- Post content would be a required field in the post form 
even though the content field is nullable in the database schema.
- UI wow factor is not important for the purpose of this technical test.
Making very pretty UI is a huge time waster for me when there are no mockups.

### Shortcuts/Compromises made
Shortcuts:
 - Used `Material-UI` because of my familiarity with it. 
 - Used `react-hook-form` for the post form and `yup` fields validation.
 
Compromises:
 - I didn't write any automated testing. 
The fact that I usually use Typescript(interface vs prop types)
and that I have never used Next.js and Prisma before 
made me spend a lot more time inside the documentation than I usually would for this kind of feature. 
Of course, I could have used a more familiar project setup, but
I thought it would be good to use this technical test as an educational experience. 

 - I didn't use the markdown library for the content input 
because I wanted to keep the UI as simple as possible for the first iteration of the feature. 
This would have surely been an improvement I would have explored.

 - There a couple of warnings in the console, which I would have normally fixed.

 - The code could have been cleaner. I would normally take the time to refactor 
and make sure my code follows the team's standard.   
### Assume your application will go into production...

#### 1) What would be your approach to ensuring the application is ready for production (testing)?
 - Implement a battery of functional testing
 - Review my code
 - Manually try to break my feature.
 - Request a peer review

#### 2) How would you ensure a smooth user experience as 1000â€™s of users start using your app simultaneously?
 - UI wise it would be interesting
to use sockets providing "real-time" updates of the journal.
 - Have an infrastructure with load balancing to achieve automatic scaling by spawning new server instances when needed.
 - Make sure the instance type/hardware hosting the database is strong enough for the required traffic.
 - It's important to keep the api/backend calls fast and efficient, especially at the data layer.

#### 3) What key steps would you take to ensure application security?
- Make sure the database is not accessible from external network. For example setting up a VPC on AWS.
- Make sure to routinely back up the database.
- Make sure the SSL certificate is set up. 
- Make sure to use cookies not locale storage to store token in the frontend.
- Sensitive data like a password must be encrypted.
- Keep key dependencies like authentication libs, encryption libs, framework libs 
and the language version are up-to-date.
- Try to design UI with DDoS in mind.
- Sanitize HTML (React takes care of that mostly in our case)
- Have strong application logging/monitoring
